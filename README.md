# snake-game-using-ai

The project involves developing an AI agent to play the Snake game using a neural network model. The neural network architecture includes an input layer with 11 features representing the game state, a hidden layer with 300 neurons for learning patterns, and an output layer with 3 neurons, possibly representing decision-making or value estimation. The goal is to train the AI to effectively navigate the Snake game environment, potentially by predicting optimal actions based on the game state.
